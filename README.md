# üìå REST API Project with Spring Boot and JWT

This project is a **REST API** built with **Spring Boot**, using **JWT for authentication** and **PostgreSQL** as the database. The application is fully containerized with **Docker**.

---

## üöÄ **How to Start the Project**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Docker Image**
Run the following command to build the image without using cache:
```sh
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Services**
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Running Containers**
```sh
docker ps
```

## üõ† Managing PostgreSQL
### Check Running Services (macOS)
```sh
brew services list
brew services stop postgresql
sudo lsof -i :5432
```

### Check Running Services (Windows)
```sh
netstat -ano | findstr :5432
```

## üîê HTTPS Access Notes
The API is served over HTTPS at https://localhost

Since it uses a self-signed certificate, curl commands require the -k flag to skip SSL verification

In a browser, you may need to accept the certificate manually the first time

## üß† Optional: Enable LLM Recommendations
This project includes an optional book recommendation system powered by a local LLM (Large Language Model).

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Enable LLM Integration
Navigate to the llm/ folder in the project root:
```sh
cd llm
```

Start the LLM service using Docker:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Once running, you can use the LLM-powered recommendation endpoint via:

```sh
curl -k -X POST https://localhost/api/llm/recomender \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "Harry Potter"
  }'
```

‚úÖ This will return a list of book recommendations in JSON format, powered by the local AI model.

### Example Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
      "author": "J. K. Rowling",
      "year": 1997
    },
    {
      "title": "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",
      "author": "J. K. Rowling",
      "year": 1998
    }
  ]
}
```
üí° The model may take a few seconds to respond. To improve speed, the prompt and model settings have been optimized.
